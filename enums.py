# Some programming languages, like Java and C++, include syntax that supports a data type known as enumerations, or just enums. This data type allows you to create sets of semantically related constants that you can access through the enumeration itself. Python doesnâ€™t have a dedicated syntax for enums. However, the Python standard library has an enum module that supports enumerations through the Enum class.

# So Enums are the only real way to create constants in Python.
from enum import Enum


class State(Enum):
    INACTIVE = 0
    ACTIVE = 1


print(State.ACTIVE.value)  # 1
print(State(1))  # State.ACTIVE

# Listing all values
print(list(State))  # [<State.INACTIVE: 0>, <State.ACTIVE: 1>]

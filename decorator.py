# A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
# In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that functions can be passed around and used as arguments, just like any other object (string, int, float, list, and so on).

# Put simply: decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior

# Python allows you to use decorators in a simpler way with the @ symbol, sometimes called the “pie” syntax.
